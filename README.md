# Phonograph

Audio Recording library supporting WAV and AAC. Takes care of the heavy  
lifting by providing a foreground service which lets you record in the
background.

This library is based on
[Audio Recorder](https://github.com/Dimowner/AudioRecorder) by [Dimowner](https://github.com/Dimowner/).

It serves as the backend to [Recordist](https://github.com/ninovanhooff/Recordist).

## Work in Progress
This project is currently used as a git submodule, it has not been  
released in a convenient way yet.
